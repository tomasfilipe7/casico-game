Mini-game developed in C++ representing a casino machine.

The user can insert coins, remove coins or start the game by pressing the respective buttons.

A game can only be started if the user has a coin inserted.
The game consists in a simple animation where the 3 middle objects will reduce its size and then grow back, changing its colors. This process 
is repeated 5 times until the animation is stopped.

During the animation, if the START button is clicked, the game will be paused.

To execute the file, you can either:

- In the project root directory, type: "make run"

or 

- Simply click on the following file: "output/main"
